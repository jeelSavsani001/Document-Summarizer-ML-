Defined as the degree of atmospheric clarity over the maximum horizontal distance observable, this parameter reliably measures changes in air quality3,4. For instance, Doyle and Dorling5 demonstrated that Vis trends in the UK over more than 40 years strongly correlated with changes in particulate matter (PM) concentrations, indicating variations in air quality. Chang et al.6 observed similar trends in six megacities in China, where rapid urbanization and industrialization significantly impacted Vis, reflecting the deteriorating air quality. Zhao et al.7 highlighted that in Northeast China, Vis impairment directly correlated with levels of particulate matter, serving as a practical measure of air pollution levels. Singh et al.8 analyzed long-term UK Vis data, showing how meteorological conditions and atmospheric pollutants collectively affected Vis, underscoring its role as an air quality indicator. Previous research revealed that the characteristics of physical and chemical properties of aerosols, namely their concentration9, chemical composition10,11, and particle size distribution12,13, exert a decisive influence over Vis behaviour9,10,11. This influence becomes particularly pronounced during autumn and winter, attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions12. Moreover, key particle components, such as (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3, and organic matter (OM), play a substantial role in Vis impairment due to their potent light-scattering effects13. Importantly, it’s observed that particles in the accumulation mode have a more pronounced impact on Vis compared to those in the coarse mode unless influenced by specific weather phenomena like sandstorms or fog. Simultaneously, meteorological factors, with relative humidity (RH) at the forefront alongside wind speed (windS) and regional pollutant transport, emerge as critical contributors to Vis degradation14. Elevated RH levels contribute to particle size growth, a result of their hygroscopic properties, influencing radiative forcing and causing fluctuations in Vis15,16. For instance, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium salts of particles are identified as potent hygroscopic species17. Furthermore, increased RH fosters gas-to-particle conversion processes of precursor gases, fostering the formation and accumulation of secondary sulfate and nitrate, thereby exacerbating Vis impairment18.\"},\n",
